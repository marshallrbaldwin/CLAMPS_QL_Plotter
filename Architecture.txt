Plotter Architecture

For each type of dataset, we need:
	
	- a valid filename checker
		- need dictionary for the right file length for each dataset type
		- develop check for 60 in seconds place and generate without

		-separately, we need a function to parse the filename
			-extracts facility and data type from filename

	- a data yoinker
		-needs to be passed a reference to the dataset type so it can execute the code specific to that dataset

	- a quicklook creator/saver
		- needs a dict of dicts for each dataset type
			- see line 96 of Plotter_old.py for reference
			- each dataset has params for each variable in dataset
		- needs a function that can be passed the file name and spit out quicklook naming scheme
		- needs a dict of dump directory paths

	- main function
		- accesses a dictionary of data folder paths specific to each dataset type
		- loops through all filenames in that directory and checks if valid
			- appends to a list of good paths
		- loops through good paths and creates quicklooks
			- creates a log file if any files don't work
